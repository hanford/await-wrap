# await-wrap

Small async/await wrapper which allows a similar paradigm to Node's callbacks mixed with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). `await-wrap` wraps any async function and respond with an array with either `data` or `err`, allowing you to use async/await with out the try/catch blocks.

## Usage

```js
const wrap = require('await-wrap')

const iResolve = async (text) => new Promise((done) => done(text))
const iReject = async (text) => new Promise((_, fail) => fail(text))

..

const [data, err] = await wrap(iResolve('jack'))
// data === 'jack', err === undefined

..

const [data, err] = await wrap(iReject('rejected!'))
// data === undefined, err === 'rejected!'
```
